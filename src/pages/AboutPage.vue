      <p>Our names are Niv and Ron and were excited to present you our FamRecipe application. <br>
         It is a simple and fun recipes website. The website enables to search for recipes, view personal
         and family recipes. <br> <br>
         Some of the previous works we did be found <a href="https://sise-web-development-environments.github.io/assignment2-niv-ron/">here</a>. <br>
        It is a PACMAN game made with HTML5 canvas and JS with JQuery.
